Back in 1901, when Dr. John, or as we call him today, Grand Daddy Wolf, ran the joint at Wolfpack Dental, he was the bee's knees among the local critters. His animal dentistry was the cat's pajamas, and everybody couldn't get enough of his talents.

Now, Grand Daddy Wolf's skills were so snazzy that he lit a fire under his sons' tails. They caught the dental bug and decided to dip their paws into treating humans. The gig turned out to be a real McCoy, and it set the stage for Dr. Johnson, his grandkid, to go full throttle with human dentistry. Grand Daddy Wolf's legacy? It's been nothing but hotsy-totsy ever since.
